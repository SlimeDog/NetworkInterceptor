# NetworkInterceptor configuration
# originally made with <3 by Luck
#
# Updated and maintained by drives_a_ford and SlimeDog

# Design: SlimeDog
# Implementation: drives_a_ford
# Testing: SlimeDog
#
# Supported MC versions:
# https://github.com/SlimeDog/NetworkInterceptor/wiki/Technical-Details
# Default configuration:
# https://github.com/SlimeDog/NetworkInterceptor/blob/master/src/main/resources/config.yml

# ========== METHODS ===============================================================================
# Network requests may be detected by either or both of the following methods.
#
# security-manager:
# * Installs a custom SecurityManager into the server
# * Will intercept all outgoing network requests
# * May be incompatible with other plugins which install a security manager
# * In particular, note that AAC disables itself if the security-manager method is enabled.
#
# proxy-selector:
# * Installs a custom ProxySelector into the server
# * Will intercept most outgoing HTTP requests
# * Will not catch requests which specifically define their proxy
# * Should not be incompatible with anything
#
# Both methods may be enabled, and are recommended.
methods:
  - security-manager
  - proxy-selector

# ========== CHECK FOR UPDATES =====================================================================
# If you do not want notification of available updates in the console log, you may disable it here.
check-for-updates: true
# Update source may be either Hangar (default) or SpigotMC.
update-source: Hangar

# ========== BSTATS METRICS ========================================================================
enable-metrics: true

# ========== PROCESSING MODE =======================================================================
# Processing mode is allow or deny
# In allow mode, outbound network connections to specified targets will be allowed.
# In deny mode, outbound network connections to specified targets will be denied (blocked).
# In either mode, trusted plugins may be specified.
mode: allow

# ========== LOGGING ===============================================================================
# Enable/disable logging of outbound network connections.
#
# Enable/disable stack traces for each connection attempt.
# Stack traces will always be included in the file output.
#
# Connection requests may be logged to the console
# or to plugins/NetworkInterceptor/intercept.log
# Options are
#   - console
#   - file
#   - all
logging:
  enabled: true
  include-traces: false
  mode: file
  truncate-file-on-start: true

# ========== BLOCKING ==============================================================================
# Enable/disable blocking.
# If blocking is disabled, logging will still occur unless disabled above.
blocking:
  enabled: false

# ========== MAPPING ===============================================================================
# Configure whether fully qualified domain names (FQDNs) are mapped to their IP addresses
# This will allow calls to IP addresses that are the result of a call to a specific FQDN
# within a certain amount of time of the former.
mapping:
  enabled: true
  # The time (in ms) within which IPs are allowed to pass as per their FQDN permissions
  timer: 1000

# ========== TRUSTED PLUGINS =======================================================================
# In allow mode, outbound network connections by these plugins will be allowed.
# In deny mode, outbound network connections by these plugins will be allowed,
# unless the target is explicitly blocked in the targets list.
#
# If LuckPerms is installed, we recommend listing it as a trusted plugin, to simplify configuration.
# Remove [] on the next line, and add the following line (without the # comment).
# - LuckPerms
trusted-plugins: []

# ========== BLOCKED PLUGINS =======================================================================
# No network connections by the listed plugin(s) will be allowed, period.
# Remove [] on the next line, and add the following line (without the # comment).
# - pluginName
blocked-plugins: []

# ========== TARGETS ===============================================================================
# Entries should be lowercase
# In allow mode, outbound network connections to these targets will be allowed.
# In deny mode, outbound network connections to these targets will be blocked.
#
# Recommended targets. Comment out or remove any you do not want to allow.
